# Introduction

GlobLib is combination of a hardware abstraction layer and common libraries which can be 
shared across multiple microcontroller units (MCU). It is designed to provide boilerplate,
cross-MCU compatible code implementation of the most commonly used features. This project 
was created to both support code reuseability and as an education exercise in multi-architecture firmware develop for myself.

GlobLib focuses on proving functionality and portability for the most common features 
of each peripheral.

### IMU

-   MPU6050
-   LSM9DS1 (SPI interface only)

## Software Modules

Additional software modules are included in COMMON with complete Doxygen generated
documentation.

# Documentation

[Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html) is used to automatically
generate extensive documentation of this collection and its features. This document
can be accessed through [Github Pages](https://stuianna.github.io/globLib/doc/doxygen/html/index.html) or by typing **make libdoc** from any of the project templates. A local copy of this repository needs to made before this documentation can be accessed.

# Installation / Usage

This whole repository should be cloned onto a local machine to function correctly.

 1. Clone this repository onto the local machine
 2. Run `chmod +x config.sh` to make the configuration file executable
 3. Execute the config file with `./config.sh`. This script sets the glob_lib variable in each Makefile to the current root directory. This should also be run if the main glob_lib folder is moved.

Each supported MCU has a templates containing a project template and specific 
instructions for its usage. These are located in under each MCU name.

# Testing

This document outlines which modules components have and haven't been tested.

## STM32F767

Currently being developed on a STM32Nucleo144 board.

### GPIO

Tested:

- GPIO_pinSetup(), pinWrite(), pinToggle() and pinSet() for digital output on
    - PB0, PB7 and PB14
- GPIO_pinSetup(), pinRead() for digital input on
    - PC13
- GPIO_pinSetup() for USART on: 
   - PD8 and PD9.
- Rising edge and falling edge interrupts on PC13

### USART

- USART_setup(), USART_put() and USART_get() on:
    - USART3C (PD8 and PD9)

### RCC

- RCC_clockEnable() for: 
    - GPIOB, GPIOC GPIOD, USART3, SYSCFG.
